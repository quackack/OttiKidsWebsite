	<h1>Ahia</h1>
	<p>Ahia is the spirit of an old gift bag named Akpa. Everytime Akpa was given to a child with a present, it was saved and reused to give another present. After many, many gifts, Akpa gained a positive energy that eventually became its own spirit, Ahia.
	</p>
	
	<p>Ahia loves giving gifts and being at parties. She is very kind and cheery, and not usually the center of attention. If you like parties, and especially presents, Ahia would be a great friend.</p>
	
	<p>Ahia is loosely based on the japanese folklore of "tsukumogami", old tools that have aquired their own spirit.</p>
