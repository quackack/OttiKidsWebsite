	<h1>Bouquet</h1>
	<p>
		Bouquet is a Ballarina garden fairy. Bouquet has a passion for dancing and her garden. She has abnormally large wings which give her a unique majestic flying style. While her wings make some ballet moves harder than for other fairies, it also lets her do things most Ballarinas can't!
