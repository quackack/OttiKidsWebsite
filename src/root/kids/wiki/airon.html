	<h1>Airon</h1>
	<p>
		A paraplegic tinker fairy. Airon likes building machines, but not just any machines, automating machines. Airon has a passion for making machines that can run on their own, and complete tasks without any help. Airon is constantly looking for repetitive, boring tasks he can automate with a robot.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Even for a fairy, not having legs is annoying. Fairies generally start flying by a skip, hop, and a jump, something Airon can't do. Still, with enough effort, he can get into the air, or with help from a friend. Still, he wants to automate things so that others can do more without help.
