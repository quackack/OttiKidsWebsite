    <h1>Welcome to Leaf's Library</h1>
	<p>Leaf's Library is our first picture book. I hope the kids in your life will love and learn from it!</p>
	
	<h2>Brown Fairies and Binary Search in a STEM Picture Book</h2>
	
	<p>Leaf loves her library, but it has become too large for her to look through! Luckily the new arrivals section is short, so she can handle those fine. But when she needs to get something from the back, it could take a whole day to find it!</p>
	
	<p>Come along with Leaf as she learns how to quickly find books in the back! Luckily she keeps all her books sorted, but how will that help her? Without binary search, it could take days. But maybe she'll figure it out before the day is over!</p>
	
	<h2>Babies First Binary Search</h2>
	
	<p>For those who don't know, binary search is a very important algorithm in computer science and mathematics. It helps us search through large databases quickly, but is also useful in many algorithms. For instance, a common proof of the intermediate value theorem in calculus uses a variation of binary search. It can be used to calculate square roots, logarithms, exponentials, and many other functions. It is an extremely generic and useful tool.</p>
	
	<p>Let's take square root for instance. The fastest methods for calculating square roots usually involve calculus and Newton's method, but those are complicated. We just want something that works. Binary search gives us a fast algorithm that is much simpler. For any positive number <strong>a</strong>, we can easily tell if <strong>b</strong> is greater than or less than the square root of <strong>a</strong>. How? By squaring <strong>b</strong> and comparing it to <strong>a</strong>. So we start by noting the square root of <strong>a</strong> is some number between zero and <strong>a + 1</strong>. Then we use binary search to find a <strong>b</strong> that is very close to the square root of <strong>a</strong>. Often <strong>b</strong> is irrational, so we may not find it exactly, but neither would a calculator.</p>

	<h1>Reviews</h1>
	<p>"As a long time educator, I love how the author uses relatability to introduce a new concept to young readers! Elements such as the library, fairies, and fun books with quirky names draws in the reader and immerses them into a world of wonder. The creative graphics are very inclusive and add excitement  to the pages with every turn. Great read for elementary aged children!" ~Dr. Ada Osorio</p>

	<h1>Where to Buy</h1>
	
	<p>Our book is available online and in some local book stores. Try to buy it locally if you can!</p>
	<h2>Local</h2>

	<h2>Online</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://stemforestbooks.etsy.com/listing/1734128266">Etsy</a>. This is the fastest and cheapest way to get our book in the US (except for buying it from a local bookstore).</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.thegreatbritishbookshop.co.uk/products/leafs-library">Great British Bookshop</a>. Operated by bookvault, our primary print on demand service.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leafs-Library-Joshua-Otti/dp/B0D6RTYDQQ">Amazon</a>. If you must, you can buy the book on Amazon. If the shipping time is less than 2 weeks, I am probably personally filling the order, just like etsy except more expensive. Otherwise, it's just being printed by bookvault except Amazon now takes a large chunk of my royalty.</li>
