    <h1>Welcome to Leaf's Library</h1>
	
	<p>Leaf's Library is our first picture book. Leaf loves her library, but it has become too large for her to look through! Luckily the new arrivals section is short, so she can handle those fine. But when she needs to get something from the back, it could take a whole day to find it!</p>
	
	<p>Come along with Leaf as she learns how to quickly find books in the back! Luckily she keeps all her books sorted, but how will that help her? Without Binary search, it's hopeless. But maybe she'll figure it out before she faints from the work!</p>
