    <h1>Welcome to Leaf's Library</h1>
	
	<p>Leaf's Library is our first picture book. Leaf loves her library, but it has become too large for her to look through! Luckily the new arrivals section is short, so she can handle those fine. But when she needs to get something from the back, it could take a whole day to find it!</p>
	
	<p>Come along with Leaf as she learns how to quickly find books in the back! Luckily she keeps all her books sorted, but how will that help her? Without Binary search, it's hopeless. But maybe she'll figure it out before the day is over!</p>

	<h1>Reviews</h1>
	<p>"As a long time educator, I love how the author uses relatability to introduce a new concept to young readers! Elements such as the library, fairies, and fun books with quirky names draws in the reader and immerses them into a world of wonder. The creative graphics are very inclusive and add excitement  to the pages with every turn. Great read for elementary aged children!" ~Dr. Ada Osorio</p>
