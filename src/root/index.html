    <h1>Welcome to Stem Forest Books</h1>
	
	<p>This is the official home page of Otti books. We currently only have one book, <a href="./leafslibrary.html">Leaf's Library </a>, but plan to add many more soon. And maybe merchandise, who knows? But for now, why don't you check out our book for Leaf's Library!</p>
	
	<p>We also have an AI generated music album to introduce you to stem forest characters. <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/r7i7VftpaLGnq7DE8">Check it out</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>About Us</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Binary Search</li>
		<li>Zero Knowledge Proofs</li>
		<li>Game Theory</li>
		<li>Hash Functions</li>
		<li>Sorting Algorithms</li>
