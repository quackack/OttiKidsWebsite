    <h1>Welcome to Stem Forest Books</h1>
	
	<p>This is the official home page of Stem Forest Books. We currently only have two books, <a href="./leafslibrary.html">Leaf's Library </a>, and <a href="./tenisbest.html">Base ten is Best, Binary is Better</a>. We also have shirts available on etsy! But for now, why don't you check out our book for Leaf's Library!</p>
	
	<p>We also have an AI generated music album to introduce you to stem forest characters. <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/r7i7VftpaLGnq7DE8">Check it out</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Stem Forest Books teach kids stem topics that are simple enough for children under 12, but are generally not taught below college. We focus on topics from computer science, but also discuss physics and math topics as well. Some examples of topics we want to teach include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Binary Search</li>
		<li>Binary Numbers</li>
		<li>Zero Knowledge Proofs</li>
		<li>Game Theory</li>
		<li>Hash Functions</li>
		<li>Sorting Algorithms</li>
		<li>Free Body Diagrams</li>
		<li>Time Integrators</li>
		<li>Error Correcting Codes</li>
		<li>Quantum Information</li>
		<li>Bernoulli's Equation</li>
		<li>Electro-Magnetic Induction</li>
		<li>Mathematical Induction</li>
		<li>Modular Arithmetic</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Stem Forest Books are written by Joshua Otti and illustrated by Tayvin Otti. We are based in Austin Texas.</p>

	<h3>Joshua Otti</h3>
	<p>Joshua Otti is a PhD student studying theoretical computer science at the university of Texas at Austin. He worked at Amazon as a software engineer, has worked in game development and has a double major in computer science and mathematics from North Carolina State University. See his professional website <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jacook7/">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Joshua has a passion for teaching the more interesting and less common aspects of mathematics and computer science. He didn't discover set theory or formal boolean logic until after he had completed his coursework in an associates for simulation and game design from sandhills community college. In his final year at sandhills community college, while reading a booked loaned to him by David F. Sherrill, Joshua thought, "Why haven't I been taught any of this before now, after my first college degree! All of this is simpler than algebra and much more interesting." Now Joshua writes books for kids to try to teach these simple and important, but rarely taught subjects.</p>
