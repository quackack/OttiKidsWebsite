    <h1>Welcome to Stem Forest Books</h1>
	
	<p>This is the official home page of Otti books. We currently only have one book, <a href="./leafslibrary.html">Leaf's Library </a>, but plan to add many more soon. And maybe merchandise, who knows? But for now, why don't you check out our book for Leaf's Library!</p>
	
	<p>We also have an AI generated music album to introduce you to stem forest characters. <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/r7i7VftpaLGnq7DE8">Check it out</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Stem Forest Books teach kids stem topics that are simple enough for children under 12, but are generally not taught below college. We focus on topics from computer science, but also discuss physics and math topics as well. Some examples of topics we want to teach include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Binary Search</li>
		<li>Zero Knowledge Proofs</li>
		<li>Game Theory</li>
		<li>Hash Functions</li>
		<li>Sorting Algorithms</li>
		<li>Free Body Diagrams</li>
		<li>Time Integrators</li>
		<li>Error Correcting Codes</li>
		<li>Quantum Information</li>
		<li>Bernoulli's Equation</li>
		<li>Electro-Magnetic Induction</li>
