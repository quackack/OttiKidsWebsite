    <h1>Code Games</h1>
	
	<p>This game is about error correcting codes. This has two modes.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>In Parity code mode, we start with a codeword that has an even number of ones (or a number whose entries sum to something divisible by ten, etc). Then a symbol is deleted and the player must find the deleted symbol.</li>
		<li>Custom code is a two player mode. One player is the encoder and the other is the decoder. The encoder is first given a random message, and is asked to encode it. Then that encoding is given to the decoder and they must decode it. They succeed if they output the message. We then rate the result by the rate, which is the message length divided by the codeword length.</li>
	</ul>
