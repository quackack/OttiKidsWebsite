	<h1>Shop</h1>
	<p>Our book is available online and in some local book stores. Try to buy it locally if you can!</p>

	<h2>Online</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://stemforestbooks.etsy.com">Etsy</a>. This is the fastest and cheapest way to get our book in the US (except for buying it from a local bookstore).</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.thegreatbritishbookshop.co.uk/collections/vendors?q=Stem%20Forest%20Books">Great British Bookshop</a>. Operated by bookvault, our primary print on demand service. Based in the UK, so shipping to the US takes a few weeks, but their quality is very high, and my royalty from them is also very high.</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Music</h1>
	<p>Leaf's Lyric's and Airon's AI Audio. While not available to purchase, you can listen to the stem forest music for free now. This music was constructed with Udio v1.</p>
