	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://stemforestbooks.etsy.com">Etsy</a>. This is the fastest and cheapest way to get our book in the US (except for buying it from a local bookstore).</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.thegreatbritishbookshop.co.uk/collections/vendors?q=Stem%20Forest%20Books">Great British Bookshop</a>. Operated by bookvault, our primary print on demand service. Based in the UK, so shipping to the US takes a few weeks, but their quality is very high, and my royalty from them is also very high.</li>
