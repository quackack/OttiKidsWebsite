		<li><a href="https://www.thegreatbritishbookshop.co.uk/collections/vendors?q=Stem%20Forest%20Books">Great British Bookshop</a>. Operated by bookvault, our primary print on demand service. They supply the hardcovers for bookstores and have the best quality. Based in the UK, so shipping to the US takes a few weeks, but their quality is very high, and my royalty from them is also very high.</li>

	<h1>Music</h1>
	<p>Leaf's Lyric's and Airon's AI Audio. While not available to purchase, you can listen to the stem forest music for free now. This music was constructed with Udio v1.</p>
