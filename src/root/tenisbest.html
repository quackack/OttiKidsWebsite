    <h1>Love Counting, But Want to Spice it Up?</h1>
	<p>You came to the right place. Learn binary and other number systems with our second book: <em>Base Ten is Best, Binary is Better</em>.</p>
	
    <h2>A Tour of Binary and Other Bases.</h2>
	
	<p>It is counting time, so let decimal show you how. Not so fast decimal! Binary is here to show kids there are other ways to count besides decimal. There’s unary, binary, base sixty, and more! Which one do you think is best? Find out what you gain, and what you lose, when you use bigger or smaller bases.</p>
	
	<p>People use decimal numbers, while computers use binary. In computer science, it is vital that the same information can be written many different ways. You don't need to know binary to program, but it can help. However, without binary computers would be much, much slower.</p>

	<h1>Reviews</h1>
	<p>“This book is another hit from the Otti team! It's really exciting to see my class engaged in discussions and thinking critically about numbers in math.” ~Mr. Koeffler, STEAM teacher at UT Elementary</p>
	<p>“There are many ways to write numbers. Some are long, some are short. Some make it easier to add or multiply numbers. You'll learn all about them in this imagined battle of the bases.” ~Dana Moshkovitz, professor of CS at UT Austin</p>
