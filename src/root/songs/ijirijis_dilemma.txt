[Intro]

You know who was just here?
Who?
Ijiriji.
That trickster genie? No, really?
Reall!

[Chorus]
Ijiriji was here, Ijiriji was here.
Our bank's clear cause Ijiriji was here.

[Verse]
Came into town with a game to play, bet some cash and we bet the same.
Two of us agreed to a game called dilemma,
if we played nice, we'd both be big winnas.

When we agreed we were put in cells.
Like prisoners, for her trap we fell.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ijiriji was here, Ijiriji was here.
Our bank's clear cause Ijiriji was here.


[Instrumental]


[Verse]

We were both given gold rings,
and we were free to take those things.
But Ijiriji offered more gold,
if we let the other stay in hold.
But if we both tried for more,
we'd lose all the gold we had in store.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ijiriji was here, Ijiriji was here.
Our bank's clear cause Ijiriji was here.


[Instrumental]


[Verse]

Both of us were scared we'd stay
in the cell the rest of our days.
So we both asked for more,
and we lost all the gold we had in store.
Ijiriji emptied our bank,
and all our money, our hearts sank.
And all she left when she was gone,
is a record of this song.
