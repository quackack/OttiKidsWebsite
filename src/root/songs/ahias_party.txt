[Instrumental]
Is everyone here?
Seems like something is missing.

[Verse]
Look everybody, see who's finally here.
It's Ahia to bring some holiday cheer.
Ahia the bag spirit of Akpa so dear.
She brought some presents for everyone near.
Ahia the friend to all that appear.

Lets do a dance, just go with the flow.
Ahia has moves to keep you on your toes.
Talk to Ahia about all of your woes.
Ahia will stay with you for the whole show.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ahia, our favorite host.
Ahia, is not a ghost.
Ahia, give her a toast.
Ahia, the host with the most.

Ahia, the friend to all.
Ahia, she's not so tall.
Ahia, will come if you call.
Ahia, will help when you fall.

[Verse]
Hey everybody now it's time for a game.
Everyone's glad that Ahia came.
She helps everyone no matter their name.
She's just that kind of dame.

Hard to predict, nobody knows,
what move she'll make, she never shows.
Ahia looks so random to all of her foes.
So be her friend, it's what she would have chose.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ahia ya, our favorite host.
Ahia ya, is not a ghost.
Ahia ya, give her a toast.
Ahia ya, the host with the most.

Ahia ya, the friend to all.
Ahia ya, she's not so tall.
Ahia ya, will come if you call.
Ahia ya, will help when you fall.

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Come to Ahia's store later if you can.
It's the greatest market in all of the land.
Some stuff is so random, I'm telling you man,
but it's just what you need, just the right brand.

And lets not forget, her bag Akpa too.
We haven't said just all it can do.
Even though her bag may look small,
the inside is as big as a mall.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ahia, our favorite host.
Ahia, is not a ghost.
Ahia, give her a toast.
Ahia, the host with the most.

Ahia, the friend to all.
Ahia, she's not so tall.
Ahia, will come if you call.
Ahia, will help when you fall.
