[Intro]
Addition.
Addition.
All Again.

[Verse]
Another day, another problem.
Doing math, we have to solve them.

Wasting time, burns my mind.

But there is another way.
Airon comes, to save the day.

Automation time, save my life.

Aaaahhhhh

[Chorus]
Calculate the work away,
with machines that we make.

Built with logic gates.

Built from transistors and wires,
forged with chemicals and fires.

Microchip create.

Make it fast make it run!
Our results get them done!
We need lower depth!
Logarithmic or less!


[Verse]

With base 10, that's just wasteful.
Binary is far more tasteful.

Just base two, faster too.

Started with a ripple carry,
saving time for the fairies.

Simple small, but too tall.

[Chorus]
Calculate the work away,
with machines that we make.

Built with logic gates.

Built from transistors and wires,
forged with chemicals and fires.

Microchip create.

Make it fast make it run!
Our results get them done!
We need lower depth!
Logarithmic or less!

[Verse]

Adding is almost xor
the carry's far too stressful.

Constant depth, carry's left.

To carry we look ahead,
we get lower depth instead.

Bigger size, but alright.

[Chorus]
Calculate the work away,
with machines that we make.

Built with logic gates.

Built from transistors and wires,
forged with chemicals and fires.

Microchip create.

Make it fast make it run!
Our results get them done!
We need lower depth!
Logarithmic or less!

[Guitar Solo]

Lower Depth.
Logarithmic or less.
We need lower depth.
