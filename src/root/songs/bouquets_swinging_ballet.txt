[Intro](Fairies in the breeze)

[Verse, Solo]
Bouquet the beautiful ballerina fairy.
Faintly floating, flying freely.
A Fae among fairies.
Dancing almost daily.

[Duet]
Bring your babies, your boys and girls,
to the best ballet in all the world.
See them sing on a swinging swing,
see them twist and twirl their wings.

Breeze!

[Orchestra and Nature Sounds]

Fairies dancing in the breeze!

[Build up]

[Chorus]
Bouquet the ballet fairy.
Bouncing, dancing, acting merry.

Flying free as a body can be.
Feeling just wind and gravity.

The wind torques and twirls her around,
till she touches upon the ground.

The normal stops gravity pulling her down,
the friction stops her sliding around.

[Orchestra and Nature Sounds]

[Build up]

[Verse]
They set up the swing, but somethings not right.
Its out of sync with the song and the flight.

They added weights but there's no change.
They change the speed and rearrange.

But there is no change at all.
It takes the same time for it to fall.

So Bouquet wrote a diagram.
And did kinematics, and then bam.

It depends on the length of string.
A shorter branch balanced things.

[Chorus]
Bouquet the ballet fairy.
Bouncing, dancing, acting merry.

Flying free as a body can be.
Feeling just wind and gravity.

The wind torques and twirls her around,
till she touches upon the ground.

The normal stops gravity pulling her down,
the friction stops her sliding around.

[Outro]

Fairies dancing in the Breeze.

The torque, the force, inertial change.

Acceleration, momentum change.

Bouquet the fairy dancing free.
