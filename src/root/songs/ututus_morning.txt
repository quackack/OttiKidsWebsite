[Instrumental](Ututu the will-o-wisp)

[Verse]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances and spins.
She twirls and predicts what happens.
Her flames burn bright, when she plays,
the brilliant light lights her stage.

[Chorus]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances in the morning sun.
She helps the lost, and predicts what to come.
She flys and she spins and she has fun.

[Verse]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances in the forest glade
Some travellers visit where it's forbade.
On a limb, the moment is too great
she scares them off before it breaks.

[Chorus]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances in the morning sun.
She helps the lost, and predicts what to come.
She flys and she spins and she has fun.

[Verse]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances to scare them away.
She burns the limb to protect them all,
Ututu knew as the limb decays,
it gets weaker and they might fall.

[Chorus]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances in the morning sun.
She helps the lost, and predicts what to come.
She flys and she spins and she has fun.

[Verse]
Ututu the will-o-wisps watches as the travellers run.
She sees their bag with all they had is about to come undone.
Ututu pulls the bag closed and seals it tight.
The travellers are safe and Ututu delights.

[Chorus]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances in the morning sun.
She helps the lost, and predicts what to come.
She flys and she spins and she has fun.

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Ututu the will-o-wisp goes to the stem forest,
and her fairy friends stand before us.
She does ballet with the fairy Bouquet
and they dance the rest of the morning away.

[Chorus]
Ututu the will-o-wisp dances in the morning sun.
She helps the lost, and predicts what to come.
She flys and she spins and she has fun.
