[Verse]
Kris the Quantum Fairy
safe in their sanctuary.
They interact with friends,
but quantum begins when that ends.

[Chorus]
Still, cold, and unobserved.
They tunnel through walls,
it's not absurd.
No signals at all,
they beat games.
No classic players could coordinate the same.
Superdense coding and so many tricks,
when quantum fairies have coherence.

Let's see what Kris gets.

[Verse]
Kris the quantum fairy,
caught lightning in a jar, maybe.
That's what Kris wants to know,
if they open it, then it could blow.
So they measure it very gently,
and finds the lightning made entry.

Kris gave it to Airon their friend
who needed it for his inventions.
Airon asked how did Kris know,
Kris said they could not show.
it wouldn't go, it could blow, don't you know?

[Chorus]
Still, cold, and unobserved.
They tunnel through walls,
it's not absurd.
No signals at all,
they beat games.
No classic players could coordinate the same.
Superdense coding and so many tricks,
when quantum fairies have coherence.

[Bridge]
Don't watch, don't observe.
What you see changes the world.
Leave Kris alone until their done,
decoherence ruins the fun.

[Drop]
[Chorus]
Still, cold, and unobserved.
They tunnel through walls,
it's not absurd.
No signals at all,
they beat games.
No classic players could coordinate the same.
Superdense coding and so many tricks,
when quantum fairies have coherence.

[Outro]
When Quantum fairies have coherence.
The frequencies that they can get.
So many complex things to happen yet.
When quantum faires have coherence.
