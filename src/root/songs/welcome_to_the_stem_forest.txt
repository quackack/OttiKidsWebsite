[Intro]

Welcome to the stem forest,
come be one of our guests.

Talking plants and fairies,
in the stem forest daily.

[Verse]
Welcome to the stem forest.

Ahia welcomes our guests,
visit her shop, it's the best.

Drop by Bouquet's studio for ballet,
watch her dance or perform plays.

Leaf has her library, open to all.
Read cozy books from now till fall.

Have a task you don't want to do?
Airon has a robot to help you.

[Chorus]
Stem forest, come visit us,
we'll have fun come along.

Data structures are no fuss,
learn with us, sing our song.

Do a dance, read a book,
Grow a garden, watch the sky.

Fly with fairies, have a look.
Love yourself and ask why.


[Verse]

Kris is in the hill nearby,
Grover searching for their tie.

Other magic creatures too,
like gnomes and the kitsune.

In the stem forest is a lake,
come there if you need a break.

It's sand holds mysteries lost to time,
listen to Miri sing and rhyme.

[Chorus]
Stem forest, come visit us,
we'll have fun come along.

Data structures are no fuss,
learn with us, sing our song.

Do a dance, read a book,
Grow a garden, watch the sky.

Fly with fairies, take a look.
Love yourself and ask why.

[Verse]
Come to the swampy glade,
you have a guide so it's okay.

Ututu's running weather simulations,
a very common situation.

Is that Ijiriji, what does she say?
Don't agree to any of her games.

There are Tylwyth Teg's and more,
see what stem forest has in store.

[Chorus]
Stem forest, come visit us,
we'll have fun come along.

Data structures are no fuss,
learn with us, sing our song.

Do a dance, read a book,
Grow a garden, watch the sky.

Fly with fairies, take a look.
Love yourself and ask why.

[Outro]
Stem forest, come visit us,
Math and physics are no fuss.

We'll have fun come along.
Learn with us, sing our song.

Grow a garden, come and fly,
Love yourself and ask why.
