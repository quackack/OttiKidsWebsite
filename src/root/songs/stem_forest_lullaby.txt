[Intro]

Night time.
Rest time.
but also
flight time,
best time.
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]

The suns down
on the stem forest.

But not all around
think it's time for rest.

The Tylwyth Teg come out of bed,
and dance in fairy circle's instead.

The fire fly's and moths abound
And night dragon's come out of the ground.

[Instrumental]

[Verse]

The night flowers bloom,
will-o-wisps soar.
The fire flies zoom,
The Kitsune's snore.

[Chorus]

The suns down
on the stem forest.

But not all around
think it's time for rest.

The Tylwyth Teg come out of bed,
and dance in fairy circle's instead.

The fire fly's and moths abound
And night dragon's come out of the ground.

[Instrumental]

[Verse]

Leaf lies in her flower bed,
her roots drinking the nutrients in.

Kris has a book that they've read,
and Ahia tucked Akpa in.

Mmiri is in the deep,
Ututu is home.

Some animals leap
up over gnomes.

Most fairies sleep,
but some still roam.


[Outro]

The suns down
on the stem forest.

But not all around
think it's time for rest.

The Tylwyth Teg come out of bed,
and dance in fairy circle's instead.

The fire fly's and moths abound
And night dragon's come out of the ground.
