[Intro]
Otu, Abuo, Ato, Ano

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Mmiri the aquatic plant girl

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.


[Verse]

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Mmiri sings and she has fun, playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

walking around in the sun, playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Mmiri lives in the lake nearby, playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

and visits when its not dry, playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

[Chorus]

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing with friends and no rest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Fluid dynamics to the test.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

[Bridge]

A big storm happened last night,
and Mmiri wonders why.
Water fell from the sky,
and Mmiri wonders why.
It flooded Kris' spot,
and Mmiri wonders why.
On a hill, it was the top,
and Mmiri wonders why.
The water should want to go down,
and Mmiri wonders why.
But it's stuck in a hole for now,
and Mmiri wonders why.

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Need to clear Kris' nest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Fluid dynamics to the test.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri


[Bridge]

Kris tries to scoop it out,
and Mmiri wonders how.
There must be a faster route,
and Mmiri wonders how.
Mmiri thinks about digging a trench,
and Mmiri wonders how.
So it will flow into the ditch,
and Mmiri wonders how.
But digging woud take too long,
and Mmiri wonders how.
But the water wants to be gone,
and Mmiri wonders how.


[Instrumental]


[Verse]

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Mmiri realized if she got a hose,
thinking in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

and the water rose,
thinking in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

And the other side ended low,
thinking in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Then it would syphon and flow,
thinking in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri


[Chorus]

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

The syphon cleared Kris' nest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Singing for Bouquet's dance.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Fluid dynamics to the test.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri

Playing in the stem forest.

Nwaanyi Ahihia Mmiri
